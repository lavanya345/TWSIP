Here is a small description for the Gradio app you implemented in Python, suitable for uploading to GitHub:

Text-to-Text Translation with a T5 Model

This Gradio app allows you to translate text from one language to another using a T5 model. T5 models are a type of large language model that can be used for a variety of tasks, including translation, summarization, and question answering.

To use the app, simply enter the text you want to translate in the input field and click the "Translate" button. The app will then generate the translated text in the output field.

This app is still under development, but it can be used to translate text between a variety of languages. It is also a good example of how to use Gradio to create a simple and easy-to-use web application for machine learning models.

Usage:
  
   1. Enter the text you want to translate in the input field.
   2. Click the "Translate" button.
   3. The translated text will appear in the output field.

Example:
                      Input: This is a sentence in English.
                      Output: Esta es una oración en español.
